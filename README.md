<p>Hello, In this assignment I wanted to do some sort of catalog where you have cards and can choose your favorite hero, then go to a diffrend page through SPA to see your favorite heros that you choose. I figured that I'll create "catalog" of heros that I know form my childhood so I did 5 cards, each card containes title of the hero, a star so you know that you have choosen this specific hero, an image of a hero and last but not least a button "favorite". When you click this button the content of the card goes to local storage but then the button changes into Remove from favorite, I use the localSotrage.removeItem property and basicaly reversed the favorite function so that it removes item from the local storage. when you have chosen you can click "your favorite heros" and what this button does is that it has two functions.</p>

<p>first function is: that it changes the inner html so that is the SPA part of this project.</p>

<p>second function is: localStorage.getItem which only displays the items that are in local storage which you choose.</p>

<p>If you want to return to the main page you can refresh the site and if you go into "your favorite heros" you can see that your favorite heros are still there.</p>

<p>If you want to remove a hero after you refresh wensite you can click twice on the button on the card of the hero tha you want to remove.</p>

<p>I worked a lot on this project, I learned a lot by making this site and I did my best, I am confident that I gained the required skilles and knowledge. I think that it could be bit ambisous and needs more time to be finished, also that's why there are somethings that needs fix like when you go into the "Your favorite hero" there is no "go back" button and you need to refresh to go back or when you refresh the state of the button and star are gone(does not effect the local storage), I think that these are just minor things, bacause the functionality is still there.</p>

<p>I Hope you like it, and maybe these characters will bring back some memories :) </p>
